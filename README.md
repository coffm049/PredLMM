## Data Description

The example data files provided were generated following the simumlation of section (3.2.1) of the main manuscript. In the folder named "Data", there are 

* a phenotype file: "example_pheno.csv"
* a covariate file: "example_covar.csv"
* PLINK binary files: "example_geno"
* GCTA GRM files: "example_grm"

There were 5000 many individuals and 10,000 many SNPs. First two columns of the phenotype and covariate file have the family ID (FID) and individual ID (IID) of each individual. 
There are only one phenotype and one single covariate (intercept term). With the binary files, Genetic Relationship Matrix (GRM) files have been computed using GCTA.
